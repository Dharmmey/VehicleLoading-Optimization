# VehicleLoading-Optimization

Overview
The Vehicle Loading and Route Optimization project is a solution designed to optimize business’ delivery operations of orders to customers. The system determines optimal van capacity utilization and efficient customer drop-off sequences, ensuring cost-effective logistics and timely deliveries.

Key Features
1.	Optimized Van Loading: Allocates packages based on weight, volume, and van capacity constraints.
2.	Route Optimization: Uses data-driven heuristics & algorithms to minimize delivery time and fuel costs.
3.	Customer Drop-off Sequencing: Determines the most efficient drop off sequence of orders when making deliveries. This is made efficient due to clustering of customers.
4.	Dynamic Re-Optimization: Adjusts routes based on real-time conditions.
5.	Scalability: Supports multiple vans, large delivery networks, and dynamic demand fluctuations.
6.	Customized Rules: It accommodates business’ customized rules of operations. Such as restriction of large vehicles in certain locations, preferred drop off sequence if certain locations are part of a delivery trip etc.
